# portfolio-152

This portfolio website is a personal project built using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a simple and clean platform to showcase my skills. The website includes a responsive navigation bar with links to various sections like Home, About, Projects, Skills and Contact along with social media icons linking to Github, Youtube and Instagram.

The main content is divided into several sections.The "Home" section introduces who i am and what i do, followed by the "About" section which gives a brief summary of my learning journey in web development.The Projects section highlights three of my HTML/CSS lab projects using card layouts with images and descriptions.The "Skills" section displays a list of my technical abilities and the Contact section provides my email, location, college name and links to social profiles for easy reach.

Styling is handled entirely through CSS.The website uses flexbox for layout, consistent color themes (mainly green and white), and a mobile-friendly responsive design with media queries.Visual elements like buttons,cards and skill tags are styled for clarity and user engagement.Overall, this project helped me apply what i learned in class and build a presentable portfolio from scratch.
